# Topic-CombineItems

Good day, I have finished something small here.
If your inventory script does not support this function, this is the perfect script!

You have in this script the possibility to combine two items to one or three to one. I named the variables and functions after the needed information, as well as what they do.

[Animation List:](https://alexguirre.github.io/animations-list/) [https://alexguirre.github.io/animations-list/](https://alexguirre.github.io/animations-list/)

To note is in the "**client.lua**" in line **24**. Here you have to replace your progressbar, if you don't have this [rprogress](https://github.com/Mobius1/rprogress) Progressbar.

**Please do not republish this script or sell it on other platforms.**

If you have any questions, I will help them on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/492wzewBj9).
